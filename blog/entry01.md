## Reasons For Space Exploration

I have many reasons for choosing Space Exploration for my project. Since elementary school, I was passionate about Space, and always learned fun facts about planets. In 5th grade, I realized my dream to work as an Engineer at NASA after seeing Perseverance land on the surface of Mars, so my first thought for this project was that I should learn more about technology and space.  I looked at other topics for my freedom project, such as Animation and Chemical Engineering, but researching Space exploration and how technology was used in it was much more enjoyable than anything else. Even if I didn't enjoy those topics as much as space, some articles were fun to look at, such as ["What is CGI in Movies and Animation?"](https://boords.com/blog/filmmaking-101-what-is-cgi-in-movies-and-animation) by Jakob Straub. This article explained how CGI changed animation and how it's used for various projects. Another good article was ["Emerging Technologies in Chemical Engineering"](https://www.chemicalindustryreview.com/news/emerging-technologies-in-chemical-engineering-nwid-438.html) by The Chemical Industry Review, which talked about how Chemical Engineers use Simulations to test real-world situations. After immense research, I stumbled upon an article about space exploration that amazed me. It is ["How Fully Reusable Rockets Are Transforming Spaceflight"](https://www.global-aero.com/how-fully-reusable-rockets-are-transforming-spaceflight/) by Global Aerospace Editorial Team, and it talks about how reusable rockets can change space flight forever, and how these can help space exploration since rockets can now go from Earth and back. The more articles I found about technology in space exploration, the more excited I got, which made me realize that it should be the final option I choose. 

## Engineering Design Process

At the moment, I am at my first step of the Engineering Design Process. This is where I define the problem. I want to research more about what technology still doesn't exist in the modern world that will help space exploration, or research more about how technology today is changing to learn more about space. Then I want to talk about my findings and tell my peers about it. In the next step, I can look through articles and videos that contain questions about what's in space that we still don't know, and then I can think of an invention that can help find the answer to this question.  So one day, if scientists discover my ideas, maybe they can create something and actually make a discovery!
