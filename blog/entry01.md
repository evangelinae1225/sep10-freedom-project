## Reasons For Space Exploration

I have many reasons for choosing Space Exploration for my project. Since elementary school, I have been passionate about Space, and always learned fun facts about planets. In 5th grade, I realized my dream to work as an Engineer at NASA after seeing Perseverance land on the surface of Mars, so my first thought for this project was that I should learn more about technology and space.  I looked at other topics for my freedom project, such as Animation and Chemical Engineering, but researching Space exploration and how technology was used in it was much more enjoyable than anything else. Even if I didn't enjoy those topics as much as space, some articles were fun to look at, such as ["What is CGI in Movies and Animation?"](https://boords.com/blog/filmmaking-101-what-is-cgi-in-movies-and-animation) by Jakob Straub. This article explained how CGI changed animation and how it's used for various projects. Another good article was ["Emerging Technologies in Chemical Engineering"](https://www.chemicalindustryreview.com/news/emerging-technologies-in-chemical-engineering-nwid-438.html) by The Chemical Industry Review, which talked about how Chemical Engineers use Simulations to test real-world situations. After immense research, I stumbled upon an article about space exploration that amazed me. It is ["How Fully Reusable Rockets Are Transforming Spaceflight"](https://www.global-aero.com/how-fully-reusable-rockets-are-transforming-spaceflight/) by Global Aerospace Editorial Team, and it talks about how reusable rockets can change space flight forever, and how these can help space exploration since rockets can now go from Earth and back. The more articles I found about technology in space exploration, the more excited I got, which made me realize that it should be the final option I choose. 

## Engineering Design Process

At the moment, I am at my first step of the Engineering Design Process. This is where I define the problem. I want to research more about what technology still doesn't exist in the modern world that will help space exploration, or research more about how technology today is changing to learn more about space. Then I want to talk about my findings and tell my peers about it. In the next step, I can look through articles and videos that contain questions about what's in space that we still don't know, and then I can think of an invention that can help find the answer to this question.  So one day, if scientists discover my ideas, maybe they can create something and actually make a discovery! 


## Skills

#### Attention to Detail 

While writing this blog entry, I had to always make sure my spelling was accurate since GitHub doesn't have autocorrect.  So if I felt I spelled the word wrong, I searched up the spelling just in case to make sure everyone could understand my writing clearly. So this is me paying attention to my writing. I will probably learn how to spell my words more accurately after many writing projects in this class. As well, I had to make sure I'm using the markdown language correctly to make sure it looks how I want it to, so a simple extra hashtag or a simple space can ruin my first blog entry. So I'm making sure I'm typing what I want accurately. 


#### Time Manaagment 

Lately, many classes have been giving me a lot of homework assignments, such as projects and simple assignments. This means I had to organize time for the freedom project. Every day, I've been adding more to this specific blog entry. On Monday, I finished my context, on Thursday, I completed my engineering design process, and on Saturday, I completed my skills section. I planned this out perfectly, so most of my three-day weekend is gonna be free, so I can enjoy my free time with friends and family. It's also so I don't have to worry about completing my blog entry while I'm at ComicCon. 


#### How to Google 

If you search "Space Exploration Technology" on Google, there will be many articles since Technology is what's mainly used for space exploration. So I decided I should search for "New Space Exploration Technology" and I stumbled on the Article about how rockets can now go into space and back. Not only did I find this information cool, but I also learned that if I'm more specific with my Google searches, it's easier to find the specific information you are looking for. I also learned that even if you can't use Google Gemini because it isn't always accurate, you can check the sources of where it got the informaitoon. So you can check it out for yourself and see how reliable the source is. 


## Summary 

In conclusion, space Exploration is what I will be researching for my Freedom Project this year. I hope I can use my HTML skills that I'm learning and use them to teach people about new technology being made to support our understanding of the universe. Not only that, I hope I can use this experience as a way to improve my skills that are required for daily life.
