# Entry 2: Researching My Topic (Space Exploration)

## Introduction
On my last step of the engineering design process, I decided I would be researching software and hardware for space exploration. So when the time came, I started researching. 
#### Software 
I started with software, and decided to first search up "Space Exploration software". It was a pretty straightforward search, and one of the first things I found was [Space Engine](https://spaceengine.org/universe/planets-and-moons). I learned that Space Engine is a virtual simulation where you can explore space, land on any planet, and even alter the speed of time to look in the future or past. On their website, they talk about how their simulation mechanics match real-world experiences like the opposition surge, which is how objects reflect light, though they are facing the opposite of their light source. I then decided to do another search and wrote "Software programs for space exploration". One of the top searches was  [NASA's Eyes](https://science.nasa.gov/eyes/), which is a section on NASA's website with different simulations of rover landings or tracking Asteroids. This is very similar to Space Engine, but it isn't customizable, and you can only choose a few experiences. I then decided to move on to Hardware. 
#### Hardware
For Hardware, I had a much wider selection. I first searched "Reusable Rockets", since I did research on it while trying to pick a topic. The website I opened first was the [The Official Website for SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9). The rocket's name is Falcon 9, and this website explains what each part of the rocket does and how many times it has been used. This website aswell had a bunch of other SpaceX technology, and how it was used. I then decided to search for the "James Webb telescope". Though I know it is well known, not many people know how it works. NASA's official website's [James Webb Telescope Section](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/#Featured-Image) obviously popped up, so I looked into it. It talked about how the Telescope looks back 13.5 billion years, to study galaxies that came after the Big Bang. The way it reaches space is by folding up to fit in a rocket, and when it gets to space, it opens up. It also orbits much farther than Hubble, which helps with research aswell. Lastly, I searched up "Unknown Space Technology" and found Tissue Chips. NASA's website talked about it in the article called ["Tissue Chips Accurately Model Organs in Space"](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/tissue-chips-accurately-model-organs-in-space/). Tissue Chips mimic real human cells, so we can test radiation on human skin before testing on actual people. These Tissue Chips were originally made for biological research to test things such as the effect of drugs on the human body, without using actual people directly, but it was eventually led to being used by NASA to study the effects cells have in space. Aswell, these are better than some other Chip models because they use real human cells to study, which makes it more authentic. This concludes my research.
