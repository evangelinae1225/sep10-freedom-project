# Entry 2: Researching My Topic (Space Exploration)

## Introduction
On my last step of the engineering design process, I decided I would be researching software and hardware for space exploration. So when the time came, I started researching. 
#### Software 
I started with software, and decided to first search up "Space Exploration software". It was a pretty straightforward search, and one of the first things I found was [Space Engine](https://spaceengine.org/universe/planets-and-moons). I learned that Space Engine is a virtual simulation where you can explore space, land on any planet, and even alter the speed of time to look in the future or past. On their website, they talk about how their simulation mechanics match real-world experiences like the opposition surge, which is how objects reflect light, though they are facing the opposite of their light source. I then decided to do another search and wrote "Software programs for space exploration". One of the top searches was  [NASA's Eyes](https://science.nasa.gov/eyes/), which is a section on NASA's website with different simulations of rover landings or tracking Asteroids. This is very similar to Space Engine, but it isn't customizable, and you can only choose a few experiences. I then decided to move on to Hardware. 
#### Hardware
For Hardware, I had a much wider selection. I first searched "Reusable Rockets", since I did research on it while trying to pick a topic. The website I opened first was the [The Official Website for SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9). The rocket's name is Falcon 9, and this website explains what each part of the rocket does and how many times it has been used. This website aswell had a bunch of other SpaceX technology, and how it was used. I then decided to search for the "James Webb telescope". Though I know it is well known, not many people know how it works. NASA's official website's [James Webb Telescope Section](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/#Featured-Image) obviously popped up, so I looked into it. It talked about how the Telescope looks back 13.5 billion years, to study galaxies that came after the Big Bang. The way it reaches space is by folding up to fit in a rocket, and when it gets to space, it opens up. It also orbits much farther than Hubble, which helps with research aswell. Lastly, I searched up "Unknown Space Technology" and found Tissue Chips. NASA's website talked about it in the article called ["Tissue Chips Accurately Model Organs in Space"](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/tissue-chips-accurately-model-organs-in-space/). Tissue Chips mimic real human cells, so we can test radiation on human skin before testing on actual people. These Tissue Chips were originally made for biological research to test things such as the effect of drugs on the human body, without using actual people directly, but it was eventually led to being used by NASA to study the effects cells have in space. Aswell, these are better than some other Chip models because they use real human cells to study, which makes it more authentic. This concludes my research. 

## Engineering Design Process
At the moment, I'm at the second step of my Engineering Design Process, or researching the problem. I searched for different software and hardware technologies that are related to space exploration, whether it was a simulation or a rocket. In this step, I found it was much easier to research Hardware, since that's what's mostly used in space exploration. My next step is to brainstorm possible solutions. So I need to think of a new invention or program that can help space engineering. I will probably make something that can look even farther into deep space, that isn't exactly a telescope. Maybe something like a device that can send and receive specific sorts of waves, but over longer distances than we can do now. But that's just what I'm thinking of for now. 

## Skills

#### Organization 

While researching, I mixed up my software and Hardware Research, which was probably due to the lack of organization. So next time, I'll clearly divide my notes into multiple sections for better understanding. Like for example, in this Blog, I divided the introduction into two parts, hardware and software. I also had to find a new way to organize this blog because it's supposed to be written slightly differently than Blog One, because before it was about the first step of the Engineering design process. So I had to write in a way that would represent the second engineering design process instead of the first one. 


#### Time Management 

Lately, I've been procrastinating  on a lot of homework assignments and doing them late at night. So around 9-10 pm. But while writing this blog, I decided that I need to get my work done, especially since this is a big assignment worth a lot of my grade. So I started working on it much earlier than before, aka 5 pm. When I was stumped and didn't have the motivation to work, I gave myself a five minute break, and then went back to work. This worked flawlessly, and I'm almost done with this assignment. 


## Summary 

In conclusion, I'm ready for the next step in my Engineering design process, and I'm already starting to think of Inventions that can help space exploration. I also wonder how we will brainstorm in class?
