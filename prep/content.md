  * Space engine is a virtual simulation where you can explore space, land on any planet, and even alter the speed of time to look in the future or past.
  * In the [article section](https://spaceengine.org/articles/), it sometimes explains some phenomenons that happen in the simulation and how it connects to real life, helping to learn more about space
  * Space Engine is free aswell, which means its accesible to anyone who has a computer
