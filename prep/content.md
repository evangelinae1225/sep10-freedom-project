## Part A: existing technology
#### Simulations
* My first search was "Space Exploration software"
* The first website I opened was [Space Engine](https://spaceengine.org/universe/planets-and-moons)
  * <img width=250px src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/314650/capsule_616x353.jpg?t=1742336096" alt="SpaceEngine on Steam"/>

  * Space Engine is a virtual simulation where you can explore space, land on any planet, and even alter the speed of time to look in the future or past.
  * In the [article section](https://spaceengine.org/articles/), it sometimes explains some phenomenons that happen in the simulation and how it connects to real life, helping to learn more about space
  * Space Engine is free as well, which means it's accessible to anyone who has a computer
  * This app is perfect for anyone wanting to explore space and answer questions they may have, such as what would happen if Earth were as big as Jupiter?
  * This helps with a greater understanding of how celestial bodies function and how they would react in different situations, with a visual representation.  
* My second search was "Software programs for space exploration" 
  * I found that on NASA's website, there is a section called [NASA's Eyes](https://science.nasa.gov/eyes/) 
  * On this section of NASA's website, you can look at many 3D models of things, such as a recreation of a rover landing or tracking asteroids, all in 3D
  * It's easy to use, especially since the instructions are seen in the Simulation, so you can know how to explore around the simulation
  * <img width=200px src="https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cassini-grandfinale-4x3-1.jpg?resize=600,450">
  * You can learn more about how rovers land on different atmospheres or explore different planets
     * On that website, there was also a 3D simulation, but it shows the signals we get from space to earth in real time, which isn't exactly 3D, but is still a cool simulation on that website
#### Large Tech that is sent to space
* My second search was "reusable rockets" since I wanted to do more research on it
  * The website I opened first was the [The Official Website for SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9)
  * <img width=200px src= "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTCn-pClFrAYFsAvWONyuuPo8wmchKIigZnMg&s" alt="spaceX"/>
  * This specific part of the website talked about the first reusable rocket, it showed images, videos, and an overview of the Falcon 9, or the first reusable rocket.
  * The website shows each part of the Reusable rocket and what it's used for, as well as how many times Falcon 9 was used for
  * This website also  shows more rockets and inventions that were invented by SpaceX
  * This website also talks about new ways for humans to travel to space using Dragon, which is important for future space exploration
 * My third search was "James Webb telescope" since I know it's often used to study galaxies, stars, planets, etc.
    * I went to NASA's official website and into the [James Webb Telescope Section](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/#Featured-Image)
    * <img width=200px src="https://d182hggomw8pjd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/01/04141412/2000x1333-JamesWebb-C.jpg" alt="james web telescope"/>
    * The website talked about how it pears back 13.5 billion years ago to look at galaxies that came after the Big Bang
    * Also, to go to space, it folds up to fit in a rocket, and in space, it opens up
    * Also, the James Webb telescope orbits much farther from the Hubble telescope, showing improvement
    * It also has SPF protection of 1 million, so it can survive the sun's, Earth's, and moon's radiation
#### Biological Tech 
* The last I searched up was "Unknown Space exploration technology" and stumbled upon Tissue Chips
   * I found NASA talking about it(not surprising anymore), and it was in this article called ["Tissue Chips Accurately Model Organs in Space"](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/tissue-chips-accurately-model-organs-in-space/)
   * This article talked about how Tissue chips mimic real human tissues and are used to test how space radiation would affect actual human cells.
   * It's important to use Tissue Chips because we can study the effects of space travel on human cells, so that in the future, when we go to explore space, we know what to expect and are protected from such issues
   * These Tissue Chips were originally made for biological research to test things such as the effect of drugs on the human body, without using actual people directly, but it was eventually led to being used by NASA to study the effects cells have in space
   * These are better than some other Chip models because they use real human cells to study, which makes it more authentic
* [biosensor](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20020048428/downloads/20020048428.pdf)
   *  Can continuously track basic physiological parameters, such as heart rate, blood pH, and body temperature
   *  Important for people going to explore space in the future, aswell as people on the ISS
