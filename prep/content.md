## Part A: existing technology
* My first search was "Space Exploartion software"
* The first website I opened was [Space Engine](https://spaceengine.org/universe/planets-and-moons)
  * <img src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/314650/capsule_616x353.jpg?t=1742336096" alt="SpaceEngine on Steam"/>

  * Space engine is a virtual simulation where you can explore space, land on any planet, and even alter the speed of time to look in the future or past.
  * In the [article section](https://spaceengine.org/articles/), it sometimes explains some phenomenons that happen in the simulation and how it connects to real life, helping to learn more about space
  * Space Engine is free aswell, which means its accesible to anyone who has a computer
  * This app is perfect for anyone wanting to explore space and answer questions they may have, such as what would happen if earth was as big as jupiter?
  * This helps with greater understanding of how celestial bodies function, and how they would react in different situations, with a visual representaion.  
* My second search was "reusable rockets" since I wanted to do more research on it
  * The website I opened first was the [The Offical Website for SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9)
  * <img src= "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTCn-pClFrAYFsAvWONyuuPo8wmchKIigZnMg&s" alt="spaceX"/>
  * This specific part of the website talked abput the first reusable rocket, it showed images, videos, and overview of the Falcon 9, or the first reusable rocket.
  * The website shows each part of the Reusable rocket and what its used for, aswell as how many times Falcon 9 was used for
  * This website also  shows more rockets and inventions that were invented by SpaceX
  * This website aswell talks about new ways for humans to travel to space using Dragon, which is important for future space exploration
 * My third search was "James Webb telescope" since I know its often used to study galaxies, stars, planets, etc.
    * I went onto NASA's offical website and into the [James Webb Telescope Section](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/#Featured-Image)
    * <img src="https://d182hggomw8pjd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/01/04141412/2000x1333-JamesWebb-C.jpg" alt="james web telescope"/>
    * The website talked about how it pears back 13.5 billions of years ago to look at galaxies that came after the Big bang
    * Also to go to space it folds up to fit in a rocket and in space it opens up
    * Also the James Webb telescope oribits much farther from the Hubble telsecope showing improvement
    * It also has SPF protection of 1 million so it can survive the suns,earths, and moons radiation
